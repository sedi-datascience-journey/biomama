Ready to create your blog on GitHub? Follow these simple steps to get started!
### **What You'll Achieve**
By following these steps, you'll:
1.	Sign up for GitHub.
2.	Create a repository for your blog.
3.	Set up GitHub Pages to host your blog.
4.	Add your first blog post.
***
## **1. Sign Up for GitHub**
â€¢	Go to [GitHub](https://github.com) and click **Sign Up**.
â€¢	Create an account using your email, username, and password.

## **2. Create a New Repository (This Will Be Your Blog's Home)**
â€¢	After logging in, click the + icon in the top right corner and select **New Repository**.
â€¢	**Repository Name**: Name it something like "biomama."
â€¢	**Description**: Add a brief description such as "My bioinformatics learning journey and projects."
â€¢	**Public**: Make sure to choose "Public" so others can view your blog.
â€¢	**Initialize with a README**: Check this box to create a basic file where you can add an introduction.
â€¢	Click **Create Repository**.

**Congratulations!** Youâ€™ve just created your first GitHub repository. ðŸŽ‰

## **3. Set Up GitHub Pages**
â€¢	In your new repository, go to **Settings** (a tab near the top).
â€¢	On the left-hand menu, scroll down and click **Pages. **
â€¢	Under **Source**, select **Deploy from branch** and choose the **main branch**.
â€¢	Click **Save**.

After a few moments, GitHub will give you a link to your website. This is your blog's URL, which you can share with others!

## **4. Create Your First Blog Post**
â€¢	Now, letâ€™s add some content. Start with a simple text post.
â€¢	Go back to your repository and click **Add File > Create New File.**
â€¢	**File Name:** Use the format _posts/YYYY-MM-DD-your-first-post.md (replace YYYY-MM-DD with todayâ€™s date, e.g., 2024-10-16). GitHub uses this format to organize blog posts.
â€¢	**Write Your Post:** Add the following content to the text box:

```markdown

Welcome to my blog! Today, Iâ€™m starting my journey in bioinformatics. Stay tuned for more updates.
```

â€¢	Scroll down and click **Commit New File** to save your post.

## **5. View Your Blog**
â€¢	Wait a few minutes for your post to go live.
â€¢	To see it, go back to **Settings > Pages**, and click the link to your GitHub Pages site. Your blog should now display your first post!

#### Now, you have a live blog! Or do you? In my case, the first post didnâ€™t show up as expected. If you're facing the same issue, donâ€™t worryâ€”you're not alone. In my next post, I'll share how I tackled this obstacle and more challenges I encountered along the way. Stay tuned!
