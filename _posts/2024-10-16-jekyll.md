## How I Brought My Blog to Life with a Jekyll Theme
***

As I mentioned before, after completing all the steps, I realized something was wrongâ€”my blog page was completely blank, and my first post didnâ€™t show up! I needed a theme to bring my blog to life.

To solve this, I decided to use [Jekyll]( https://jekyllrb.com/) , a tool that helps you create simple websites or blogs. It takes your text (written in formats like Markdown) and turns it into a static website. **Jekyll** is popular for blogs because it makes it easy to write posts, customize the design, and publish the site on platforms like GitHub.

Here are the steps I took to apply the Jekyll theme I chose:

1. Since GitHub supports [Jekyll themes]( https://pages.github.com/themes/) , I picked one that was cute and simple. I went with the Dinky theme.

2. On the homepage of the [Dinky theme](https://github.com/pages-themes/dinky) , I found the instructions for applying it. I needed to create a config.yml file and add the following code snippet:

    ```

    title: "BioMama - The Storyteller"
    description: "Data analysis lover, mom, and storyteller. Join me on my journey."
    remote_theme: pages-themes/dinky@v0.2.0
    plugins:
    - jekyll-remote-theme
    
    ```

3. After that, I scrolled down and clicked **Commit New File** to save my changes.

Now, my blog has a theme, and it looks much better! Of course, there are many tweaks I could make to personalize it further, but for now, this is good enough.

**But wait**â€” thereâ€™s still a problem. Why can't I see my first post? What did I do wrong? ðŸ¤”
