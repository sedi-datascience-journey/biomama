I'm excited to kick off my journey with this very first post on BioMama! As someone who's still learning the ropes, my first challenge was figuring out how to create a blog using GitHub. It wasn’t always easy, but I’m here to share the steps I took, the obstacles I encountered, and how I managed to overcome them.

This series will focus on straightforward, easy-to-understand tutorials aimed at beginners who are just starting out—just like I was! Whether you’re new to GitHub or just want a simple guide, you’ll find practical steps and helpful tips here.

So, let's get the ball rolling and dive into the journey together!
